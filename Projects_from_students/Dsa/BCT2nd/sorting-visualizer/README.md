# Sorting Visualizer
![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/tk)

This is a Sorting Visualizer program that displays a graphical representation of various sorting algorithms. It was implemented using Python's `tkinter` library for the GUI and allows the user to visualize: 
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
